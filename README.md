Long-term ideas/goals

Initial Idea
Creating a telemedicine application aimed at regions where medical services might not be readily available, making physical medical services more accessible - preventing unnecessary fatalities.


Relation to the Selected Development Goal
Selected goal - goal three  → “Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages”

How did we relate to this development goal?
Online application - guarantees that physical location will not be an issue when consulting 
Free services - helping those who may not have the financial means to seek out health services in their region
Prevention of mortalities caused by avoidance of medical treatment


Details
→ Hypothetical inner workings of the application
User signs up for an account
Required information is input
Name
Age
Sex
Address/relative region (in order to make use of local services)
User selects one of the care options
Online survey
User is able to select symptoms that they are experiencing
Option to add images (sometimes useful in diagnosis)
Follow up with more questions/clarifications sent after a verified medical professional reviews the survey 
Diagnosis!
Online chat
User is able to fill out survey - doctor online is able to access symptoms list
Doctor asks follow-up questions live
Could request an image of condition/ask the patient to identify areas on a diagram
Diagnosis with less wait time
Video call
User is given the option to fill out symptom survey first, or tell medical professional live
Ability to show through video physical symptoms
Live diagnosis
User is provided a follow-up
User provided a care plan - at the end of their selected option
Follow-up - to see if the care plan was effective



→ Included features
Account creation
Password protection - limited amount of attempts to sign into the account
Secure password creation - specification required for password creation (special character, certain length, at least one number, variety of upper and lowercase letters)
Data encryption - sensitive medical data → is safe even in case of breach
Would allow for critical care - that might be stigmatized in a particular region 
Storage of previous interactions - keeping a medical history
Might make light of a developing condition - for doctors to refer later
Resource network 
Connecting users to physical treatment centers - if the condition is found to be critical enough
Location of the nearest/most accessible pharmacies - if the healthcare provider provides a prescription


Long-term ideas/goals
Expansion of languages that services are offered in
Sponsership program
If user required immediate care → could be very expensive 
In order to offset cost, and to prevent possible death - users could apply to get their medical costs reimbursed
